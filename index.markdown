  Currently I am an engineer at Gannett responsible for maintaining the cloud and platform as a service architecture. My team manages the delivery of our automation standards and both custom and vendor SaaS tools. My background as an engineer is with Chef configuration and Amazon Web Services though I dabble in whatever I can. I love to learn and have found the IT industry both challenging and extremely rewarding due to the pace of change. I am always looking for new projects and technologies to learn even if they are outside of my core focus.
