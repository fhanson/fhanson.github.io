In December of 2020 I left Gannett and joined New Relic. During my 7 year tenure with Gannett I built friendships and relationships that mean the world to me. When I first joined Gannett in 2013 I moved back to an IC role from hands on management at a startup. I was fortunate to find leadership that allowed me to be part of building the future and I would never have guessed where my journey would take me. My role shifted many times during my tenure moving into management in the devops/SRE space and moving into managing product teams responsible for our paywalls and user management systems.

In 2021 I start this year excited to be outside of my comfort zone. I am thankful for the opportunity at New Relic and I mean to make the most of it.
