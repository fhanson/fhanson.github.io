title: Building BD-3

Poking around reddit for costume ideas for Awesomecon 2025 I came across a [design for building BD-1 from Jedi: Fallen Order](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4078727). I hadn't printed anything this large before but I loved the idea of animating it with lights and sounds. After printing a couple of the inital parts I started looking at how others had remixed it to make it unique.
