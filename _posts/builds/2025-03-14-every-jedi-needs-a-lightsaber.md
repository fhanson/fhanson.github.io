For years I've had a Darth Vader lightsaber and an Obi Wan Kenobi lightsaber hanging on my wall next to some classic Star Wars posters. Iconic as they are I always felt like I was missing the best green saber, the Luke Skywalker green lightsaber from Return of the Jedi.
When I bought the ones for my wall I searched and never could find a good price for one. Recently my kids have started playing with them and I got that itch again to search for the missing green saber. What I found is that the custom lightsaber community has come a 
long way since I built my own out of sink parts in college. I tested the waters with a VHC lightsaber I found on amazon and the fire was lit. **I definitely** need my own lightsaber.

The amazon lightsaber was nice but it was lit from the hilt and not in the blade like the ones
I was used to. Poking around on reddit and discord I found [Vire Sabers](https://viresabers.com/). Two mystery boxes later and my wife and I had new lightsabers to battle with the kids. As fun as they were I wanted to tinker a bit more than just with the sound files and I
ended up ordering a [Proffie Board](https://fredrik.hubbe.net/lightsaber/v6/). When that arrived I got started building a new chassis to fit inside of the VHC hilts. I also realized it would be fun to try a hand at adding a screen and a crystal like some of the more advanced
sabersmiths out there. With some time and effort I got the hang of fusion360 and what a game changer that is from what I could do before.

I ended up making one for my wife first while I sorted out the neccesary wiring for the Proffie. It was easier to test on hers where we had all the parts from the existing electronics. I think I must have printed about 6 prototypes while trying to find optimal sizing and strength.
It didn't help that I was having a bear of a time with PETG. I ended up going back to PLA since I had poor settings for layer adhesion.
Once I had the electronics working I shifted back to designing a chassis for the Proffie.

It didn't take long for the design to shape up. For fun I slapped on some paint to set the color off on the navy filament I chose. I went with gold accents to match the color of the hilt.

I had to move the choke around from where I originally imagined to accomodate the longer length of the chassis but it worked out quite well.

I really appreciated all the community resources out there. Particularly the work done on Proffie.
