I have spent the last 7 years evangelizing cloud enablement within Gannett/USA TODAY. I have been fortunate to be able to lead an amazing group of engineers representing our internal shared services platforms within our product organization. At home I am a father to an infinite ball of energy and husband to an endlessly patient wife. When I am not chasing a toddler around I spend my time playing video games and building model railroads.
