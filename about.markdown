I am a father to an infinite ball of energy and husband to an endlessly patient wife. When I am not chasing a toddler around I spend my time playing video games and building model railroads. At work I manage a group of teams at New Relic focused on performance and reliability within the telemetry data platform. Prior to New Relic I spent the previous 7 years evangelizing cloud enablement within Gannett/USA TODAY. My team was an amazing group of engineers building the internal shared services platform.
